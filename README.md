PROJECT:DATA ANALYSIS WITH COMPLEX QUERIES

#Introduction

Analyzing sales data effectively is crucial for identifying trends, improving performance, and making informed business decisions. This guide provides a complete SQL script for creating a sample sales dataset and executing advanced queries to uncover meaningful insights. You can use this as a practice exercise or adapt it to your real-world datasets.

#Dataset Creation and Overview

The dataset models a simplified sales record, including:
•	sale_id: Unique identifier for each sale.
•	sale_date: The date of the sale.
•	product_id: ID of the product sold.
•	region: Region where the sale occurred.
•	sales_amount: The monetary value of the sale.

Steps:
1. Create the sales_data Table: Use the CREATE TABLE statement to structure the dataset.
2. Insert Sample Data: Populate the table with diverse sales data across regions, products, and time periods.

#Advanced Query Applications

A. Monthly Sales Trend with Growth:
This query calculates total sales per month, compares it to the previous month, and computes the growth or decline.

B. Top 5 Regions by Total Sales:
Identifies regions generating the highest sales.
Use Case: Allocate resources to high-performing regions or address underperforming ones.

C. Sales Rank by Product:
Ranks products based on their total sales volume.
Use Case: Highlight best-sellers and underperforming products to refine 

D. Regional Sales Distribution:
Calculates the percentage contribution of each region to the overall sales.
Use Case: Gauge regional market share and prioritize regions with higher growth potential.

E. Running Total of Sales by Region:
Provides a cumulative view of sales within each region over time.
Use Case: Evaluate regional growth trends and track progress towards targets.

#Insights and Recommendations

1. Visualization Techniques:

•	Monthly Sales Trends: Line charts to highlight changes over time.
•	Regional Sales Distribution: Pie charts to emphasize percentage contributions.
•	Top Performing Products: Bar charts to rank sales figures.

2. Report Writing:

•	Summarize key findings, such as which months, regions, or products performed best.
•	Provide actionable insights, e.g., focus on expanding in regions with high sales growth or optimizing inventory for top products.
